## Tailwind CSS Production Build

For production deployments, it is recommended to build Tailwind CSS locally rather than relying on the CDN. This provides better performance and removes external dependencies.

To generate a minified production-ready CSS file, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build:production
```

This will create a `style.css` file in your project root. When deploying to production, ensure that your `header.php`, `admin/header.php`, and `user_header.php` files are updated to link to this local `style.css` file instead of the Tailwind CSS CDN.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

2.  **Configure Environment:**
    Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your database credentials and any other required API keys (Stripe, etc.).

3.  **Run Database Migrations:**
    This will set up all the necessary tables in your database.
    ```bash
    php scripts/run-migrations.php
    ```

4.  **Create an Admin User:**
    To access the admin panel, run the following script to create a default admin account.
    ```bash
    php scripts/create_admin.php
    ```
    (Note: You can change the default credentials in the script itself.)

5.  **Run the Application:**
    Use a local PHP server or configure a virtual host to point to the project's root directory.

## üí° Basic Usage
