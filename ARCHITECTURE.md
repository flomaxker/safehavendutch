Architecture Alignment & Progress Report
Summary
Your Week 2 backend progress is well-aligned with the planned “GDPR-Compliant Dual-Login CMS” architecture. The foundational work on authentication, database scaffolding, tests, and CLI tooling provides a solid base for the upcoming booking engine, user dashboards, and Stripe payments. There are no major architectural mismatches. By tackling complex backend components first, you have set the project up for smoother UI and feature development.
1. Alignment with System Architecture
Your current implementation strongly aligns with the core architectural goals.
Role-Based Authentication
You have established a secure email and password login system with session tracking ($_SESSION['user_id']), matching the plan.
Recommendation: Ensure you are using password_hash() and password_verify() for credential storage, a key security requirement.
The separation of an admin/ directory lays the groundwork for the dual-dashboard system (Admin vs. Parent) as intended.
Secure Session Management
Your current approach of gating protected pages by checking for a user session is correct.
Next Step: Harden session security by regenerating session IDs on login (session_regenerate_id(true)) and setting secure cookie parameters (Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite). This is a minor but critical addition.
Ensure role-based access control is consistently applied to all admin-only pages and scripts.
Configuration & Database
The use of a .env loader and a PDO-based Database class is perfectly in line with the project plan.
Using PDO with prepared statements correctly prevents SQL injection vulnerabilities.
The command-line interface (CLI) for database migrations aligns with the planned professional developer workflow, making the application portable and maintainable.
Testing Framework
Setting up PHPUnit tests, even as stubs, fulfills a key requirement from the project plan.
This foundation for testing will be invaluable for maintaining system reliability as you add complex features like scheduling and payments.
2. Groundwork for Future Features
The work completed is essential scaffolding for the system's primary features.
Database Schema & Migrations
The current schema for users, packages, and purchases provides the necessary skeleton for the booking system.
The migration system will allow for the straightforward addition of future tables (lessons, lesson_bookings, waitlist) without rework.
The existing credit_balance in the users table directly supports the planned credit-based booking model.
Stripe Payments & Credit System
Your implementation of Stripe Checkout, webhooks, and the user credit system is exactly as envisioned in the architecture.
The PaymentHandler and stripe_webhook.php flow for updating user credits upon successful purchase is a critical piece of the e-commerce functionality, and it is now complete.
This infrastructure is robust and ready to support both package purchases and future per-lesson payment models.
Foundation for Booking Engine
With user authentication in place, you can ensure that only logged-in parents can book lessons.
The Composer-based workflow will make it easy to add the planned sabre/vobject library for parsing iCal availability feeds.
The established pattern of using models for database interaction (PackageModel) can be replicated for Lesson and Booking models, keeping business logic clean and organized.
Admin and Parent Dashboards
The admin-side package management pages serve as an excellent template for future CRUD interfaces (for users, lessons, etc.).
The backend data structures are now in place to support the Parent dashboard, which will primarily query and display data like upcoming lessons, child profiles, and credit balances.
The Stripe checkout flow can be seamlessly integrated into the Parent dashboard with a "Buy Credits" button.
3. Recommendations & Minor Gaps to Address
Your progress is excellent, with no major red flags. The following are minor items and reminders for future implementation.
Complete Auth Security Hardening:
Implement CSRF protection (unique tokens in forms) for all state-changing actions (create, update, delete).
Set session cookies to be Secure, HttpOnly, and SameSite=Strict.
Add a GDPR consent checkbox during user registration, storing consent in the database.
Ensure Consistent Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
Add a role column (admin, parent) to your users table if you haven't already.
Implement a strict check at the top of every admin-only page to verify the user's role and redirect if unauthorized.
Plan for Child Profiles:
The next logical step for the database is to add a children table, linked to the users table via parent_id.
Booking records in the lesson_bookings table should then reference child_id to support parents with multiple children.
Consider Future Enhancements (Optional):
The current architecture supports future additions like Stripe Subscriptions or package expiration rules. These would be extensions, not rewrites. For example, a purchase_date could be used to enforce credit expiry.
4. Confidence & Next Steps
You should be confident in your progress. The foundational work is the most difficult to change later, and you have implemented it correctly according to best practices. The remaining tasks involve building features on top of this solid base, which will be a more straightforward process.
Recommendations for Upcoming Sprints:
Week 3 (Booking Engine):
Define the lessons and bookings database schemas.
Integrate an iCal parsing library for teacher availability.
Use database transactions to prevent race conditions when booking limited slots.
Week 4 (Dashboards):
Leverage your existing admin pages as templates for new management interfaces.
For the Parent dashboard, focus on clear presentation of data (lessons, credits).
Create a reusable PHP include for checking session and role status on protected pages to avoid code duplication.
Weeks 5-6 (Polish & QA):
Integrate planned libraries like TinyMCE (for the blog) and PHPMailer (for emails).
Circle back to finalize security tasks: CSRF protection, rate-limiting on login, and implementing the GDPR "right to be forgotten" data deletion script.
Conclusion: You are on track to deliver a robust, secure, and compliant CMS. The backend architecture is sound and aligns perfectly with the project goals. Proceed with confidence.
