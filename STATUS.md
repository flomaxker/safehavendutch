# Safe Haven Dutch - Project Status & Context

### **Note:** This document is the single source of truth for both technical and design direction. It is to be updated manually as tasks are completed.

---

## 1. Project Overview
A custom-built, GDPR-compliant CMS for a Dutch coaching service, featuring separate dashboards for administrators and clients (parents) to manage lesson bookings and user data. The product is designed for future licensing to schools, businesses, and organizations.

The core brand values are **warmth, safety, clarity, personal growth, and cultural belonging**. The user experience should feel supportive, emotionally safe, and gently guided.

## 2. Visual & UX Inspiration
All new UI development must closely follow the style, structure, and user experience of the **Logip dashboard by Halo Lab** (see attached `logip-dashboard.jpg`).

*   **Layout:** Clean, modern, responsive, and dashboard-centric with a left sidebar for navigation, a central area for KPIs and tasks, and a right sidebar for activity/profiles.
*   **Color & Style:** A warm, emotionally supportive color palette with soft backgrounds and subtle, playful color accents for highlights and status. Use rounded corners and subtle shadows.
*   **Interactivity:** Meaningful microinteractions (hover states, gentle animations) that improve usability without being distracting.
*   **Microcopy:** Friendly, supportive, and clear language inspired by the tone of Duolingo and the clarity of Notion.
*   **Accessibility:** All development must meet WCAG 2.1 A standards, including readable contrast, keyboard navigation, and alt text.

## 3. Core Architecture
- **Dual-Login System**: Separate, secure dashboards for Admins and Parents.
- **Credit-Based Economy**: Parents purchase credits via Stripe, which are then used to book lessons.
- **Service-Oriented Backend**: Core functionalities like Database access, Mail, and Calendar services are encapsulated in the `/app` directory.
- **Migration-Managed Database**: The MySQL database schema is managed via versioned SQL migration scripts.

## 4. Tech Stack & Key Commands
- **Backend**: PHP 8.1, MySQL
- **Frontend**: HTML5, Tailwind CSS, Alpine.js
- **Dependencies**: Composer, PHPMailer, Stripe PHP SDK, sabre/vobject
- **Testing**: PHPUnit

- **Install Dependencies**: `composer install`
- **Run Migrations**: `php scripts/run-migrations.php`
- **Create Admin User**: `php scripts/create_admin.php`
- **Run Tests**: `vendor/bin/phpunit`
- **Build CSS for Production**: `npm run build:production`

## 5. Key Directory Structure
- **/app**: Contains the core application logic, including the `Database` wrapper, `Mailer`, `iCal` parser, and data `Models`.
- **/admin**: The backend administrative dashboard for managing all aspects of the site.
- **/migrations**: Holds all SQL database migration scripts in chronological order.
- **/scripts**: Contains command-line helper scripts for tasks like running migrations or creating admin users.
- **/vendor**: Composer dependencies.
- **/tests**: PHPUnit test files.

## 6. Development Status

### âœ… Completed Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure registration, login/logout for both Admins and Parents, including role-based redirection and rate limiting.
- **Package & Payment System**: Admins can manage lesson packages. Parents can purchase credits via Stripe, with webhooks correctly updating their balance.
- **Booking Engine (Core)**: The backend logic for creating bookings is implemented, including transactional safety to prevent double-booking.
- **Admin Dashboard (Core)**: Admins can manage packages and view all bookings.
- **Parent Dashboard (Core)**: Parents can view their credit balance and a list of their upcoming lessons.
- **Dynamic Site Content**: Admin can manage the homepage, about page, blog, and site branding (logo, hero image).
- **Admin Dashboard KPIs**: Enhanced admin dashboard to display key performance indicators including total users, total bookings, and total revenue.
- **UI/UX Enhancements**: Improved admin and user dashboard aesthetics, including wider sidebars, styled main content areas, and optimized chart/activity panel layouts.

## 7. User Roles
-   **Admin**: Manages all site content, users, children, lessons, packages, bookings, and system settings.
-   **Parent**: Manages their own profile and their children's profiles, purchases credits, and books lessons.
-   **Teacher**: Views their schedule and adds feedback/notes for completed lessons.

## 8. Database Schema Overview

## 9. Key File Reference
- **Core Logic**: `/app/Database/Database.php`, `/app/Container.php`, `/bootstrap.php`
- **User Auth**: `/login.php`, `/login-handler.php`, `/register.php`, `/register-handler.php`, `/logout.php`
- **Admin UI**: `/admin/header.php`, `/admin/footer.php`, `/admin/index.php`
- **Parent UI**: `/user_header.php`, `/dashboard.php`
- **Stripe**: `/checkout.php`, `/stripe_webhook.php`
- **Booking**: `/book_lesson.php`, `/my_bookings.php`
- **Migrations**: `/scripts/run-migrations.php`

## 10. Coding Conventions
- **PHP (OOP)**: `PascalCase` for classes, `camelCase` for methods (e.g., `findUserById`).
- **PHP (Procedural)**: `snake_case` for variables and functions (e.g., `$user_id`, `get_children()`).
- **Database**: Table and column names are in `snake_case`.
- **Style**: Adhere to PSR-12 for PHP code formatting.

## 11. External Library Policy
- **Principle**: For any task involving an external library (`stripe-php`, `PHPMailer`, `sabre/vobject`), the first step is to consult its current documentation to ensure modern, secure, and non-deprecated code.
- **Workflow**:
    1.  Before writing code, identify the library and the specific feature required.
    2.  Use `resolve_library_id` to get the library's unique ID.
    3.  Use `get_library_docs` with a focused `topic` to retrieve the latest, most relevant examples and API usage.
    4.  Base the implementation on this retrieved, up-to-date documentation.

## 12. Project Workflow
- **Task Management**: The detailed "Next Steps" and "Future Steps" lists in this `STATUS.md` document serve as our primary task list.
- **GitHub Issues**: For official tracking, each major task (e.g., `[P0] Parent: Child Management`) should correspond to a GitHub Issue. Sub-tasks can be checklists within the issue.
- **Commit Messages**: Reference the relevant GitHub Issue in commit messages (e.g., `feat: Implement child creation form (closes #1)`).
- **Branching**: Create a new branch for each task (e.g., `feature/P0.2-create-child-form`).
- **Pull Requests**: Use Pull Requests for code review and merging changes. Ensure PRs reference the relevant issues.
- **`STATUS.md` Updates**: This document will be updated manually. It is excluded from Git tracking via `.gitignore`.
